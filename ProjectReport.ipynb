    "Recently, bike-sharing systems have seen increasing popularity as a means of efficient transportation in urban areas. These systems are not only a feasible solution to the world’s major environmental problems, but they also play an important role in traffic and health issues. Its users are able to rent a bicycle from a convenient depot location, and return it at another one close to the user's destination. In the U.S. alone, over 60 cities have integrated bike-sharing systems, and in densely populated cities like New York, the count of cyclists can reach 10,000 per day (Walker, 2019). The ubiquity of such programs has therefore generated investigation and analysis of quantifiable data for further effectiveness. Capital Bikeshare is one such bike-sharing system, that serves the Washington D.C. metropolitan area, and publishes yearly anonymized statistics, including the daily usage times (Capital Bikeshare). \n",
    "\n",
    "Better estimations of traffic flow under various conditions will enable bike-sharing companies to make more appropriate decisions on dispatching bikes thus maximizing bike-sharing availability and efficiency. Previous studies suggest that weather conditions have significant impacts on bike-share frequencies and fluctuation, and among various quantitative factors that define weather, the temperature is undoubtedly the most commonly used and analyzed (Gebhart & Noland, 2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "Washington D.C. has a dynamic temperature range, where the hot season can reach over 30 degrees celsius and the cold season can drop to below 0 degrees celsius (Weather Spark). Both the hot and cold season can last over 3 months, which provide extensive room for the application of different data analysis methods that require reproducible information.\n",
    "​\n",
    "The particular parameter of interest is the normalized frequency of users during different temperatures and days for bike-sharing systems. This would gauge demand, and so would be useful for possible seasonal or monthly availability decisions. The scale parameter of interest is standard deviation as it is representative of the degree of fluctuation in bike availability of the system (Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences, 2020). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is more likely to have casual users in warmer weather, it is hypothesized that both the fluctuation and the average count of rental bikes will decrease in the cold season, hence we are expecting to see that the average and standard deviation of the number of bike shares in the mild season (spring) to be larger than a cold season (winter)."

    "Our initial hypothesis was to determine if the mean count of bike rentals per day in the mild season(spring) is larger than that in the cold season(winter). As such, the result of our t-test is interpreted as being a one-sided test. Given this, in the Welch Two Sample t-test, assuming the null hypothesis is true, we have a 1.031277e-36% chance of observing a result as extreme or more extreme as our observed difference. The p-value is very small here, which means at a significance level of 0.01, the chance of getting our observed value assuming a true null hypothesis is actually very unlikely. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis at 0.01 significance. In other words, our findings show that the mean counts of rental bikes per day in spring and winter are significantly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the bootstrap analysis, we have found that the p-value is 0, within the significance interval of 0.01 as well. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis, so it is concluded that the mean counts of rental bikes per day in spring and winter are indeed different. As both the bootstrap and Welch Two Sample t-test analyses show that we should reject the null hypothesis, it was concluded that rejecting the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis to be the correct option.\n",

    "Given the reports we referenced from the journal named Transportation and the previous weather data in Washington, we originally expected to find significantly different of the count of bike rentals per day between mild season and cold season. This is because, given the Köppen climate classification of Washington being humid subtropical climate (Weatherbase, 2022), it is characterized by hot and humid summers with mild winters, resulting in large differences in weather between seasons.\n",

    "Once we loaded the data and began to analyze it, we started to see that the result is matched with our expectations. In the preliminary analysis, Figure 1 showed very different boxplots between the two seasons. However, plotting the data was not enough to come to the conclusion and our hypothesis tests confirmed once again that our initial assumption was correct.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "We have the following questions and implications for future discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The data-driven company can use the result of the hypothesis test to make decisions about bike dispatching. It’s reasonable to dispatch more bikes in the hot season than in the cold season. Moreover, with the aim to increase the use of rental bikes and make more profit, bike companies can do some promotions during winter, such as putting advertisements in public areas and offering a special discount for new users.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    ">Is there a difference between spring and summer? Referring to the side-by-side boxplot, the difference is not obvious. What decision should be made by the company if there’s a difference?\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    ">If we can access to the weather data for every specific day in Washington, we can introduce the temperature as a new interested variable to explore the relationship between temperature and the number of rental bikes per day. A linear regression model can be generated here to predict the future count of rental bikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">If we can access data for multiple cities, we can then find if climate as a whoe plays a role in bike-sharing during different seasons, by using the Köppen climate classification model climate zones."
